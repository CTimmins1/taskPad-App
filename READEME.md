# TaskPad-App
Secure Application Programming Project (BSHCCYBE4 / BSHCSD4_BSHCYB4)

---

## Overview

**TaskPad-App** is a simple web-based task management application built using **Python (Flask)** and **SQLite3**.  
The project was developed as part of the *Secure Application Programming* module to demonstrate the process of identifying and mitigating common web application vulnerabilities.

Two implementations of the same system are maintained:
- **Insecure version:** contains deliberate security vulnerabilities for demonstration and testing.
- **Secure version:** implements mitigations based on secure coding practices and OWASP guidelines.
